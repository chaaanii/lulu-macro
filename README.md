# lulu-macro
Here is a small macro designed to automatically cast spells on your ADC. 
This macro was created to work with Lulu but will also work with Nami, Janna, and other champions with a shield or heal on their E ability. 
The macro, triggered by a simple mouse click, will automatically cast Lulu's R and E spells on your ADC. 

**COMPATIBILITY :**

Compatible only with **mouse that have software** enabling the creation of keyboard macros (e.g., Razer, CoolerMaster, Logitech, etc.).
Works exclusively on **Windows**.

**INSTALLATION :**

1. Launch your mouse software and create two macros. One should simulate pressing the "7" key on your numeric keypad; this will activate the E spell.
The other should simulate pressing the "8" key on your numeric keypad; this will activate the R spell.
Set the macros' delay to the minimum and configure them to execute once (so that when you press, it triggers the macro only once).
2. Assign the macros to the mouse buttons according to your preference.
